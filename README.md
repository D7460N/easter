## ✨ Purpose
This repository provides a complete, organized documentation framework for directing, training, and sustaining church stage productions — especially large seasonal pageants such as Easter or Christmas.
It unites artistic best practices, technical operations, and spiritual formation under one clear standard.

**Primary Goals**
- Empower volunteers and leaders with clear expectations and language.
- Preserve ministry knowledge for future productions.
- Support AI/automation (via the Model Context Protocol, or MCP) for quick reference and training.
- Keep all creative work centered on **Christ, community, and excellence**.
