## ✨ Purpose

This repository provides a complete, organized documentation framework for directing, training, and sustaining church stage productions — especially large seasonal pageants such as Easter or Christmas.
It unites artistic best practices, technical operations, and spiritual formation under one clear standard.

**Primary Goals**

- Empower volunteers and leaders with clear expectations and language.
- Preserve ministry knowledge for future productions.
- Support AI/automation (via the Model Context Protocol, or MCP) for quick reference and training.
- Keep all creative work centered on **Christ, community, and excellence**.

> “Let all things be done decently and in order.”
> — _1 Corinthians 14:40_

Start in `/docs/01_introduction/vision.md` — it explains the theological and creative mission behind this documentation.

Director, Producer, Choral Director, Tech Team, Props Team, etc.

### 3. Plan Rehearsals

Consult `/docs/04_rehearsal/schedule.md` and `/docs/04_rehearsal/mock-schedule.md` for planning timelines from kickoff through Easter week.

### 4. Prepare Production Teams

Review `/docs/05_production/` for cues, lighting, props, and backstage coordination.

### 5. Lead Spiritually

Teach and model the heart of service through `/docs/06_ministry/servant-leadership.md` and `/docs/06_ministry/purpose.md`.

### 6. Use Tools and Checklists

Simplify operations with `/docs/07_glossary/checklists.md`, `/docs/07_glossary/templates.md`, and `/docs/07_glossary/feedback.md`.
