# Vision and Purpose

Every performance we create is a ministry — a visible act of worship that communicates God's story.
Our goal is not entertainment but revelation: that through story, song, and movement, audiences encounter truth, grace, and hope.

## Why We Perform

- To **glorify God** with the gifts He has entrusted to us.
- To **teach biblical truth** through creative expression.
- To **unify** diverse volunteers under one mission: sharing the Gospel.
- To **serve** our congregation and community with excellence and humility.
