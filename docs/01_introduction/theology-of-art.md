# Theology of Art and Creativity

## God as Creator

Art exists because God is creative.
From Genesis 1 onward, creation reveals design, order, and beauty that reflect His nature.

## Creativity as Worship

When we paint, act, sing, or build sets, we echo the Creator.
Our goal is not self-expression but God-expression — revealing His truth through beauty.

## Biblical References

- _Exodus 31:1-5_ - Bezalel filled with the Spirit to craft the tabernacle.
- _Psalm 33:3_ - “Sing to Him a new song.”
- _Colossians 3:23_ - “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord.”

## Application

Every creative act in ministry should:

1. Glorify God
2. Edify the Church
3. Invite others into worship
