# Expression

## Definition
Expression is the visible and audible communication of emotion, intent, and truth.
On stage, it is how faith, story, and character come to life through voice, face, and movement.

## Purpose
- To embody the emotional truth of a scene or song without exaggeration or pretense.
- To help audiences connect emotionally to the message of redemption and hope.
- To reflect the light of Christ through sincerity and authenticity in every gesture and tone.

## Core Principles
1. **Authenticity Over Acting** - Express truth, not performance; sincerity moves hearts more than dramatics.
2. **Emotion Through Understanding** - Feelings follow comprehension — know the “why” behind every word and movement.
3. **Subtlety and Control** - Use restraint; quiet conviction often speaks louder than loud emotion.
4. **Unity of Voice and Body** - Align tone, posture, and gesture so all communicate the same message.
5. **Spiritual Integrity** - Expression flows from time spent in prayer and reflection on Scripture, not from imitation.

## Best Practices
- Study the script or lyrics deeply; understand the emotion behind every line.
- Practice in front of a mirror to refine facial and body awareness.
- Ask the Director for feedback on balance — clarity without overacting.
- Match energy levels to scene dynamics and fellow performers.
- Avoid artificial emotion or self-focus; always serve the story and message.
- Use silence and stillness as powerful tools for emphasis.

## Rehearsal Focus
| Stage | Focus | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Reading | Emotional comprehension | Discuss with Director |
| Mirror Work | Facial and gesture alignment | Practice authenticity |
| Scene Integration | Vocal + physical coordination | Balance tone and presence |
| Ensemble Review | Group emotional flow | Maintain unity of tone |

## Ministry Focus
True expression on stage is an overflow of inner conviction.
When we understand the Gospel we portray, expression becomes worship — light shining from the heart to reveal Christ's truth.
