# Projection

## Definition
Projection is the art of using one's voice to speak or sing clearly and audibly without strain.
It is not shouting — it is supported, controlled breath that carries words to every corner of the room while preserving tone and meaning.

## Purpose
- To ensure every word and lyric is heard and understood by the audience.
- To communicate emotion and message with confidence.
- To protect the voice through proper breathing and technique.
- To serve both the message and the congregation through clarity.

## Core Principles
1. **Support from Breath** - The voice rides on controlled air; never push from the throat.
2. **Open Resonance** - Keep posture upright and throat relaxed for full tone.
3. **Articulation Over Volume** - Clear consonants project better than forced sound.
4. **Consistency** - Maintain even tone across dialogue, movement, and emotion.
5. **Spiritual Authority** - Speak or sing as a messenger, not a performer — carrying the Word faithfully.

## Best Practices
- Stand tall with balanced posture; imagine your voice reaching the back row, not the ceiling.
- Warm up gently before each rehearsal or service.
- Use diaphragmatic breathing — expand the abdomen, not the shoulders.
- Practice reading Scripture aloud to build clarity and pacing.
- Avoid yelling; rely on air flow, not pressure.
- Hydrate consistently and rest your voice between sessions.

## Rehearsal Exercises
| Exercise | Focus | Duration |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Deep Breathing | Air control and calm | 2 minutes |
| Tongue Twisters | Articulation and clarity | 3 minutes |
| Sustained Humming | Resonance and tone | 3 minutes |
| Scripture Reading | Pacing and conviction | 5 minutes |

## Ministry Focus
Projection is not about being heard for attention — it is about being heard for understanding.
When we project the Word of God with clarity and sincerity, our voices become instruments of His message.
