# Blocking

**Definition:**
Blocking is the planned movement of performers on stage to tell the story through action and position.

**Why It Matters:**
Clear movement helps the audience understand the message and keeps the scene orderly.
God is a God of order — not confusion — and our stage should reflect that.

**Director's Notes:**
- Blocking is finalized during rehearsals; once set, do not improvise.
- Mark positions with stage tape if needed.
- Always rehearse movement at full scale to maintain spacing.

**Volunteer Tips:**
- Note your starting and ending position in your script.
- Ask if you're unsure about direction.
- Be patient — blocking may change as scenes evolve.
