# Choreography

## Definition
Choreography is the intentional design of movement to visually communicate emotion, rhythm, or story.
In ministry, it transforms physical expression into worship — aligning the body with the message of the heart.

## Purpose
- To illustrate the story's emotion and meaning through coordinated motion.
- To unify multiple performers into a single visual language.
- To help audiences experience Scripture and message in a tangible, memorable way.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Complexity** - Movements should support, not distract from, the message.
2. **Unity and Timing** - Every performer's movement must align with others and with the rhythm or cue.
3. **Safety and Stewardship** - All choreography should consider stage size, attire, and physical capability.
4. **Spirit Over Spectacle** - Movement should glorify God, not self.
5. **Inclusivity** - Encourage participation regardless of formal dance training.

## Best Practices
- Begin with prayer and Scripture that reflect the message of the piece.
- Use natural gestures that flow from dialogue or lyrics.
- Record rehearsals for review and consistency.
- Adjust choreography to fit space, lighting, and camera angles.
- Coordinate closely with the Director, Choral Director, and Tech Team for timing and transitions.
- Avoid any movement that could be perceived as irreverent or unsafe.

## Rehearsal Process
| Stage | Focus | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Concept | Message, Scripture, tone | Develop with Director |
| Teaching | Breakdown of moves and timing | Small groups or sectionals |
| Integration | Combine with music or dialogue | Align cues and stage marks |
| Polish | Synchronization and expression | Reinforce unity and confidence |

## Ministry Focus
Choreography in worship is not performance art but an offering of movement unto God.
It visually amplifies the story of grace and invites the congregation to feel the truth of the message.
