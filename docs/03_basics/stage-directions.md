# Stage Directions

## Definition

Stage directions are the universal terms used to describe movement and positioning on stage.
They provide a shared language between directors, actors, and crew — preventing confusion and ensuring orderly, safe performances.

## Orientation

Stage directions are always given from the **performer's perspective** while facing the audience.

| Term                  | Meaning                                                | Example                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Stage Right (SR)**  | The performer's right-hand side                        | “Exit SR after your line.”       |
| **Stage Left (SL)**   | The performer's left-hand side                         | “Enter from SL on cue.”          |
| **Upstage (US)**      | Toward the back of the stage (away from the audience)  | “Step US two paces.”             |
| **Downstage (DS)**    | Toward the front of the stage (closer to the audience) | “Move DS during the chorus.”     |
| **Center Stage (CS)** | The midpoint of the performance area                   | “Deliver the final line CS.”     |
| **Wings**             | Offstage spaces used for entrances/exits               | “Wait in the SL wing until cue.” |

## Core Principles

1. **Consistency** - Always use these standard terms to avoid confusion.
2. **Safety First** - Never run or cross in front of others without direction.
3. **Awareness** - Know your position relative to others, props, and lighting zones.
4. **Respect for Flow** - Wait for your cue; every move supports the story's rhythm.
5. **Rehearsal Precision** - Record blocking notes exactly — don't improvise positions once finalized.

## Best Practices

- Keep a printed **stage map** for reference during rehearsals.
- Use **tape markings** (spike tape) for key positions.
- Learn transitions early to prevent collisions or confusion.
- Review stage directions before each run-through.
- Coordinate with the Director and Stage Manager for cue timing.

## Ministry Focus

Order on stage reflects the order of God's design.
By learning and following stage directions faithfully, we create peace, safety, and clarity that allow the Gospel message to shine through without distraction.
