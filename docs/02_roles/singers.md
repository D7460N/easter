# Singer Role Guide

## Purpose
Singers proclaim the message of Christ through melody, harmony, and presence.
Their calling is to minister, not perform — using voice and heart together to lead others into worship and understanding of God's story.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Preparation** - Learn assigned songs, harmonies, and cues before each rehearsal.
- **Participation** - Arrive on time, warmed up, and ready to contribute with humility.
- **Listening** - Blend your voice with others; prioritize unity over individual tone.
- **Expression** - Convey emotion that supports the message, not distracts from it.
- **Spiritual Readiness** - Pray over lyrics and internalize their biblical truth.
- **Collaboration** - Work closely with the Choral Director and Tech Team for mic use, stage placement, and sound balance.

## Best Practices
- Warm up before arriving to rehearsal.
- Hydrate throughout the day; avoid dairy or heavy foods before singing.
- Keep your posture open — shoulders relaxed, chest lifted, and grounded stance.
- Watch the director's cues at all times; maintain eye contact when possible.
- Encourage others and avoid self-critique during worship moments.
- Remember: your role is both musical and pastoral.

## Rehearsal & Performance Conduct
| Phase | Focus | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Warm-Up | Breathing, range expansion | Follow choral-director guidance |
| Sectional | Learn harmony and phrasing | Listen for tonal unity |
| Ensemble | Blend dynamics and cues | Adjust volume to balance |
| Performance | Worship through service | Focus on message, not self |

## Ministry Focus
Singers are storytellers of grace.
Each lyric becomes testimony, and each harmony a reflection of the Church's unity in Christ.

> “Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.”
