# Producer Role Guide

## Purpose
The producer ensures that every creative vision is supported by a realistic, organized, and sustainable plan.
They manage the operational side of the production — budgets, schedules, communication, and volunteer coordination — allowing the director and cast to focus on ministry and artistry.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Project Planning** – Establish the production calendar, rehearsal schedule, and milestones.
- **Resource Management** – Track budgets, materials, and technical needs with stewardship and transparency.
- **Volunteer Coordination** – Ensure each role is filled, equipped, and informed.
- **Communication Hub** – Serve as the primary link between church leadership, departments, and volunteers.
- **Risk & Safety Oversight** – Confirm safety checklists, emergency procedures, and compliance with church policies.
- **Post-Event Review** – Archive documents, collect feedback, and prepare reports for leadership.

## Best Practices
- Keep documentation current — schedules, rosters, and budgets.
- Create backup plans for key roles, props, and technical elements.
- Communicate early and often; clarity prevents burnout.
- Support the director’s creative vision while safeguarding the team’s capacity.
- Model calm under pressure and gratitude in every interaction.
- Treat every logistical task as ministry — service that enables worship.

## Communication Rhythm
| Area | Frequency | Focus |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Leadership Sync | Weekly | Budget, scope, resource updates |
| Department Coordination | Bi-weekly | Cross-team needs and timing |
| Volunteer Updates | As needed | Reminders, changes, encouragement |
| Debrief & Archive | Post-production | Feedback and documentation |

## Stewardship Principle
Producers manage details not for control, but for care — ensuring that creative ministry is sustainable, safe, and faithful to the church’s calling.
