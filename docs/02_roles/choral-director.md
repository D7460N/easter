# Choral Director Role Guide

## Purpose
The choral director leads vocal teams in worshipful, unified expression.
Their role bridges musical precision and ministry purpose — cultivating voices that proclaim truth beautifully and in harmony with one another.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Musical Direction** - Select, arrange, and rehearse choral pieces in collaboration with the Director and Worship Pastor.
- **Vocal Training** - Teach correct breathing, diction, blending, and tone balance suited to each ensemble's range and ability.
- **Spiritual Leadership** - Encourage prayerful preparation and remind singers that ministry comes before performance.
- **Rehearsal Management** - Plan efficient rehearsals with warm-ups, sectionals, and run-throughs.
- **Collaboration** - Coordinate with the sound and tech teams for microphone placement, dynamics, and cue timing.
- **Performance Readiness** - Ensure every member knows their entrances, harmonies, and stage posture.

## Best Practices
- Choose music that fits the congregation's voice and the message of the production.
- Foster a culture of encouragement over criticism.
- Teach singers to listen to one another, not compete for volume.
- Balance vocal excellence with heart posture — ministry always outweighs performance.
- Keep communication open with the Director, Producer, and Tech Team.
- Record rehearsals for singers to review harmonies and timing.

## Rehearsal Rhythm
| Phase | Focus | Typical Duration |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Warm-Up | Breathing, pitch matching, unison blend | 10 minutes |

## Heart of the Ministry
The choir's purpose is to proclaim God's Word through song.
The choral director models humility, discipline, and joy — leading by example both musically and spiritually.
