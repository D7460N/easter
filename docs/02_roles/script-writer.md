# Script Writer Role Guide

## Purpose
The Script Writer shapes the story that becomes the heartbeat of each production.
Their words guide movement, music, and message — weaving biblical truth into dramatic or musical form that the congregation can understand, feel, and remember.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Biblical Integrity** - Ensure all dialogue, narration, and themes are faithful to Scripture.
- **Creative Expression** - Develop engaging narratives that communicate eternal truths clearly and emotionally.
- **Collaboration** - Work with the Director, Producer, and Pastoral Team to confirm alignment with theological and practical goals.
- **Formatting** - Write in clear stage format (character, cue, note) for ease of rehearsal and technical planning.
- **Revision** - Accept feedback with humility and adjust to fit timing, audience, and production capacity.
- **Archiving** - Maintain digital copies for reuse and reference in future productions.

## Best Practices
- Begin every writing session with prayer for clarity and humility.
- Keep Scripture at the center — every line should point to Christ, not character.
- Use plain, relatable language that connects with a multi-generational audience.
- Include stage and lighting notes only where necessary.
- Respect production limitations — write within available cast, space, and time.
- Review the final draft with pastoral leadership before distribution.

## Writing Workflow
| Stage | Focus | Collaborators |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Concept | Theme, Scripture basis, tone | Pastor, Director |
| Outline | Scene flow, emotional arc | Director, Producer |
| Draft | Dialogue, cues, formatting | Writer |
| Review | Theology and flow check | Pastor, Director |
| Final | Distribution and read-through | Cast, Tech |

## Ministry Focus
Every script should move hearts toward Christ.
A well-written scene is not about applause — it's about revelation.
The Script Writer's words become instruments of grace that outlive the performance itself.
