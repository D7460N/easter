# Actor Role Guide

## Purpose
Actors bring the script to life through emotion, movement, and truthfulness.
Their goal is to tell the story faithfully — not to draw attention to themselves but to the message.

## Expectations
- Arrive prepared, on time, and ready to serve.
- Respect the director's vision and final decisions.
- Learn your lines, cues, and blocking early.
- Keep your focus during rehearsal — avoid side conversations.
- Pray before and after each rehearsal.

## Best Practices
- Develop your **character's motivation** — why they speak or move as they do.
- Use **projection** and **clear diction** so every word is understood.
- Remember the audience is not your focus — the *message* is.
