# Backstage Operations

## Purpose
The backstage area is the unseen heart of the production — where coordination, discipline, and service make the visible story possible.
A well-managed backstage honors God through order and humility, allowing the message on stage to shine without distraction or delay.

## Core Principles
1. **Reverence** - Treat backstage as an extension of worship, not casual space.
2. **Silence & Focus** - Maintain quiet; whispers and footsteps carry to the audience.
3. **Orderliness** - Keep props, cables, and costumes in their designated areas.
4. **Readiness** - Always know your next cue, entrance, or responsibility.
5. **Safety First** - Move carefully and obey lighting and equipment boundaries.

## Best Practices
- Post a **Backstage Map** marking prop tables, exit paths, and no-entry zones.
- Use **dimmed blue lights** for visibility without disrupting the stage.
- Wear dark, non-reflective clothing to remain unseen.
- Communicate via headsets or quiet hand signals only.
- Never block entrances or emergency exits.
- Stay alert and calm — backstage presence affects onstage performance.

## Cue Coordination
| Role | Focus | Communication |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Stage Manager** | Cue calls and timing | Headset or whisper cue |
| **Props Team** | Placement and reset | Visual confirmation |
| **Tech Crew** | Lighting and sound sync | Intercom or hand signal |
| **Cast Members** | Entrances and exits | Listen for cues and stay ready |

## Backstage Etiquette
- Arrive early to familiarize yourself with the space.
- Avoid personal conversations once the performance begins.
- Keep food, drinks, and personal items out of sight and away from electrical gear.
- Respect all team leaders' direction — obedience maintains unity and flow.
- Pray quietly before each performance and thank God for the opportunity to serve unseen.

## Ministry Focus
Serving backstage is a form of humble worship.
When every unseen detail runs smoothly, the message of Christ is heard clearly and without distraction.
