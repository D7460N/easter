# Stage & Rehearsal Safety

## General Principles
Safety is stewardship — protecting people and property entrusted to our care.

### Physical Safety
- Keep walkways clear of cables, props, and debris.
- Tape cords securely; use gaffer's tape only.
- Never climb ladders or rigging alone.
- Report hazards immediately to the production lead.

### Electrical & Fire
- Do not overload outlets or daisy-chain power strips.
- Know the location of fire extinguishers and exits.
- Turn off equipment before unplugging or moving.

### Emergency Response
- In any emergency, prioritize people over property.
- Call 911 when appropriate; notify pastoral staff.
- Maintain a basic first-aid kit backstage.
