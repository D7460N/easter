# Sound and Microphone Guidelines

**Goal:**
To ensure clarity, balance, and reverence in every spoken line and song.

## Basics

- Always handle microphones with care; never blow into them.
- Maintain consistent distance (2-3 inches) when singing or speaking.
- Avoid tapping or touching cables during live sessions.
- Coordinate with the sound team before rehearsal begins.

## Choir and Ensemble Notes

- Blend voices rather than compete for volume.
- Watch the director's cues for dynamics and timing.
- Remember: clarity of message outweighs musical perfection.
