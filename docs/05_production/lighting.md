# Lighting Operations

## Purpose
Lighting shapes the visual mood of every scene and directs the audience's focus.
In ministry settings, light is more than a visual aid — it symbolizes truth, clarity, and the presence of Christ.
A lighting operator serves by illuminating the story without distracting from it.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity First** - The audience must always see the message clearly.
2. **Atmosphere with Restraint** - Use lighting to support emotion, not dominate it.
3. **Consistency** - Maintain smooth transitions and avoid abrupt changes.
4. **Safety and Stewardship** - Handle all equipment carefully and follow electrical protocols.
5. **Collaboration** - Work closely with the Director, Stage Manager, and Tech Team to align cues.

## Lighting Types and Functions
| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **General Wash** | Overall illumination for visibility | Congregation scenes or group numbers |
| **Spotlight** | Highlights a focal performer or prop | Monologue or solo |
| **Accent Lighting** | Enhances mood or focus | Warm tones for worship, cool tones for reflection |
| **Backlight** | Adds depth, defines silhouette | Angelic appearances, spiritual imagery |
| **Blackout / Fade** | Scene transitions | Cue for scene change or end of act |

## Best Practices
- Test every light and dimmer before each rehearsal.
- Label all cues clearly (e.g., *LQ-1 Fade Up*, *LQ-2 Blue Wash*).
- Program fades to align with music or dialogue, not abruptly.
- Never use strobe or extreme brightness without Director approval.
- Keep spare bulbs and gels organized by color and type.
- Stay alert to cue calls from the Stage Manager during live events.

## Safety Protocol
- Never adjust lighting instruments while powered.
- Secure all cables with gaffer's tape to prevent tripping.
- Use gloves when handling hot fixtures.
- Check all clamps, safety chains, and ceiling mounts before every show.
- Keep drinks and liquids away from electrical sources.

## Collaboration & Cues
Lighting is inseparable from sound, blocking, and timing.
Coordinate with:
- **Director:** to match tone and emotion of scenes.
- **Stage Manager:** for precise cue timing.
- **Tech Team:** for synchronization with music and effects.

## Ministry Focus
Light carries both practical and spiritual meaning.
Every fade, spotlight, and color choice can help reveal the glory of God and guide the audience's attention toward His message.
