# Cues and Timing

## Definition
A **cue** is any signal or instruction that triggers an action during a rehearsal or live performance — such as an entrance, lighting change, sound effect, or line delivery.
Cues are the heartbeat of every production, turning individual efforts into a unified expression of worship and storytelling.

## Purpose
- To synchronize all elements — cast, tech, and music — in precise timing.
- To prevent confusion and ensure safety backstage and on stage.
- To maintain consistent rhythm and pacing that supports the story's emotional flow.
- To cultivate discipline and attentiveness as acts of worship.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity** - Every cue must be understood and documented before execution.
2. **Consistency** - Practice cues the same way every time; avoid improvisation.
3. **Confirmation** - Respond to cues only when received; never anticipate.
4. **Calm Execution** - React smoothly, even when changes occur.
5. **Chain of Command** - Respect cue authority: the Stage Manager or Director is final.

## Cue Types
| Type | Example | Triggered By |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Verbal Cue** | “Lights go up.” | Stage Manager or Director |
| **Visual Cue** | Hand signal or nod | Tech Lead or Assistant |
| **Audio Cue** | Music start, sound effect | Sound Tech |
| **Lighting Cue** | Scene fade or spotlight | Lighting Operator |
| **Performance Cue** | Actor line, movement, or prop action | Performer or Stage Manager |

## Cue Documentation
- Maintain a **Cue Sheet** for every performance, listing:
  - Cue number (Q1, Q2, etc.)
  - Trigger (line, sound, motion)
  - Responsible role
  - Timing notes or warnings
- Keep one printed copy at the tech booth and one backstage.
- Review and update after every full run or tech rehearsal.

## Best Practices
- Rehearse all cues during technical rehearsals, never during live shows for the first time.
- Confirm headset or communication systems are tested and functional.
- Count silently when necessary (e.g., “three-beat delay”) for smooth transitions.
- Maintain a calm, quiet environment backstage to hear cues clearly.
- Avoid side conversations during live operations.
- Debrief after each performance to note any timing issues.

## Ministry Focus
Cues teach attentiveness — the discipline of listening and responding in unity.
Just as the Church follows the leading of the Spirit, a team follows the stage manager's voice so that one message is heard, seen, and understood.
