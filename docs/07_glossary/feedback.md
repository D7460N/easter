# Feedback and Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Feedback is a gift that strengthens both ministry and community.
By sharing insight with humility and receiving correction with grace, we model discipleship and unity — ensuring the ministry continues to grow in excellence and health.

## Core Principles
1. **Constructive Spirit** - Offer feedback to build up, not to criticize.
2. **Clarity** - Be specific about what worked, what didn't, and why.
3. **Timeliness** - Submit input while details are fresh.
4. **Respect** - Direct feedback to the proper leader or department.
5. **Follow-Through** - Expect a response and review any resulting updates.
