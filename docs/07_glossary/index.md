# Ministry Overview and Index

## Introduction

The ministry section defines the heart, theology, and leadership philosophy that guide all aspects of the church's creative and stage work.
It exists to ensure that every production — from a small skit to a full Easter pageant — is grounded in biblical truth, servant leadership, and sustainable teamwork.

The purpose of this section is to align every creative decision with spiritual formation, not performance perfection.

## Ministry Philosophy

1. **Christ-Centered Creativity** - Every art form reflects the image of the Creator.
2. **Servant Leadership** - Those who lead do so by serving.
3. **Community and Unity** - Each role is part of one body working together for the Gospel.
4. **Sustainability** - Healthy teams outlast busy ones.
5. **Discipleship Through Service** - Every rehearsal is an opportunity for growth in faith.

## Ministry Focus

The ministry section exists to root the entire production effort in the life of the Church.
When creativity flows from discipleship, art becomes worship, and performance becomes proclamation.
