# Ministry Purpose

## Overview

The purpose of this ministry is to glorify God through creative expression that teaches, inspires, and draws hearts to Jesus Christ.
We use story, song, and stagecraft as tools for worship and evangelism — not for performance or applause, but for transformation.

## Core Objectives

1. **Proclaim the Gospel** - Every production communicates biblical truth and the redemptive work of Christ.
2. **Cultivate Discipleship** - Rehearsals and performances are opportunities for spiritual growth and community.
3. **Develop Gifts** - Volunteers are encouraged to use and refine their God-given talents in service to His Church.
4. **Foster Unity** - The creative arts bring together diverse skills and personalities to serve one message.
5. **Reflect Excellence** - Excellence honors God and helps others see His beauty and order.

## Ministry Philosophy

- **Worship Over Performance** - Our goal is not entertainment, but revelation — helping others encounter God through the arts.
- **Presence Over Perfection** - Authentic worship carries more power than flawless delivery.
- **Service Over Spotlight** - Every task, visible or unseen, is an act of worship.
- **Formation Over Production** - The people are the ministry; the pageant is the outcome.

| **Unity in Service**    | _Ephesians 4:16_      | Each member supports the body for growth in love.   |
| **Witness Through Art** | _Matthew 5:14-16_     | The stage becomes a platform for light, not fame.   |

## Ministry Focus

This ministry exists to bring the Word to life — to make visible the invisible truths of God.
Every note, light, and movement should whisper the same message: _Jesus is Lord._
