# Church Roles and Ministry Alignment

## Purpose
The stage and production ministry operates as part of the wider church body — under the authority of pastors, elders, and ministry leaders.
Understanding this structure ensures clarity, unity, and accountability, keeping the creative arts firmly rooted in biblical order and shared mission.

## Core Principles
1. **Submission to Authority** - Creative teams operate under pastoral oversight for both theology and logistics.
2. **Mutual Respect** - Church leadership values artistic gifts as expressions of worship and discipleship.
3. **Collaboration** - Every ministry works together to tell one unified story: Christ and His Gospel.
4. **Transparency** - Regular communication with church leadership prevents confusion or misalignment.
5. **Discipleship Over Performance** - Ministry relationships matter more than production results.

## Church Leadership Structure (Example)
| Role | Focus | Connection to Pageant Ministry |
|------|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Lead Pastor / Teaching Pastor** | Vision, theology, and approval of message content | Reviews scripts and approves final themes |
| **Executive Pastor / Administrator** | Scheduling, facilities, and resources | Coordinates calendars and logistics |
| **Worship Pastor** | Music and congregational worship | Works with Choral Director and musicians |
| **Creative Arts Director** | Oversee production, design, and volunteer teams | Supervises Director, Producer, and Tech Leads |
| **Ministry Leads / Team Captains** | Directly manage volunteer teams | Serve as point of contact for each department |
| **Volunteers** | Serve with humility and excellence | Support overall mission through individual roles |

## Collaboration Guidelines
- Hold **monthly leadership check-ins** with creative and pastoral staff.
- Submit scripts and production outlines for review early in the planning process.
- Align all creative choices (music, visuals, themes) with Scripture and church mission statements.
- Share testimonies and outcomes with the congregation after performances.
- Maintain a spirit of *partnership*, not *performance* — serving side by side as one body.

## Ministry Focus
When each part of the church serves in its place, the whole body grows in love and maturity.
The creative arts exist not apart from the church, but within it — as hands, eyes, and voices in harmony with the heart of Christ.
