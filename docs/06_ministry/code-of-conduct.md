# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
Our conduct reflects the character of Christ.
Every volunteer and leader is called to serve with humility, integrity, and respect — creating an environment where creativity flourishes and ministry remains pure.
The code of conduct ensures that all who serve on and off stage do so with unity and excellence.

## Core Principles
1. **Christlike Character** - Represent Jesus in word, attitude, and action.
2. **Respect for Authority** - Follow the direction of church leadership and ministry leads.
3. **Integrity and Honesty** - Be truthful in communication, attendance, and responsibilities.
4. **Unity of Spirit** - Avoid gossip, division, and negativity.
5. **Purity and Modesty** - Maintain personal and relational boundaries that honor God.
6. **Safety and Stewardship** - Protect people, property, and resources entrusted to you.
7. **Servant Attitude** - Put others before self; no role is too small when done for Christ.

## Behavioral Expectations
| Area | Expectation | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Punctuality** | Arrive early and prepared for rehearsals or services. | “If rehearsal starts at 6:30, be ready at 6:20.” |
| **Language** | Speak words that uplift, not tear down. | Avoid sarcasm or coarse joking. |
| **Dress & Appearance** | Dress modestly and appropriately for rehearsal and stage. | Avoid logos or apparel that distracts from ministry. |
| **Respect for Spaces** | Keep rehearsal areas, green rooms, and stages clean. | No food or drink near sound or lighting equipment. |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Address disagreements privately and biblically. | Matthew 18:15 approach — go to your brother in love. |
| **Social Media** | Represent Christ and the church with integrity online. | No negative posts about the ministry or its members. |

## Accountability & Restoration
- Repeated or serious misconduct may result in temporary or permanent removal from the team.
- Restoration and forgiveness are always the goal; disciplinary steps are handled prayerfully and privately by leadership.
- Team members who experience conflict or harm should speak directly to a team lead, director, or pastor for resolution.

## Volunteer Covenant
All participants agree to:
- Serve as ambassadors of Christ's love.
- Submit to leadership and ministry guidelines.
- Model humility, excellence, and cooperation.
- Seek unity in all things for the sake of the Gospel.

## Ministry Focus
Our unity and conduct testify louder than any performance.
When we serve with joy, purity, and humility, the message of Jesus becomes visible to all who watch — both on stage and off.
