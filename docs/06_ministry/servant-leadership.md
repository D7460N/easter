# Servant Leadership

## Definition

Servant leadership is the model of Christ — leading by serving, guiding by example, and influencing through humility.
In the creative arts, it means valuing people over production, hearts over headlines, and unity over ego.

## Purpose

The purpose of servant leadership in ministry is to reflect the heart of Jesus in every interaction and decision.
A servant leader equips, encourages, and empowers others to succeed — seeing leadership not as authority to wield, but as responsibility to carry.

## Core Principles

1. **Humility Before Authority** - True leaders seek to serve, not to be served.
2. **Empowerment Through Trust** - Delegate responsibility and celebrate others' success.
3. **Grace in Correction** - Lead with patience, restoring rather than rebuking harshly.
4. **Integrity and Accountability** - Model transparency and consistency.
5. **Faith Over Fear** - Rely on prayer and Scripture, not self-sufficiency.

## Best Practices

- Begin meetings and rehearsals with prayer and gratitude.
- Offer encouragement frequently; correction privately and kindly.
- Lead by example — show up early, stay calm, and serve joyfully.
- Keep leadership structures clear but relational, not hierarchical.
- Develop others into future leaders through mentorship.
- Remember: people follow character before they follow titles.

## Servant Leadership in Action

| Situation                                 | Servant Leader Response                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A volunteer forgets a line or cue         | Offer grace and retraining, not shame.                   |
| A tech issue delays a scene               | Stay calm, reassure the team, and redirect focus.        |
| A disagreement arises between departments | Mediate with empathy and Scripture as the guide.         |
| A team member feels overlooked            | Affirm their contribution and pray with them personally. |

## Leadership Reflection Questions

- Have I prayed for my team this week?
- Am I encouraging more than correcting?
- Am I delegating opportunities for others to grow?
- Does my attitude reflect the peace of Christ during stress?

## Ministry Focus

Jesus led through love and sacrifice — washing feet, not commanding thrones.
In His footsteps, servant leaders turn rehearsals into discipleship and productions into worship.
