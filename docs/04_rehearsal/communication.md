# Communication in Rehearsal

## Purpose

Communication during rehearsal keeps every participant aligned — spiritually, creatively, and practically.
When communication is clear and gracious, confusion decreases, morale rises, and excellence becomes attainable.

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity** - Say what needs to be said directly and kindly; avoid assuming others understand unstated plans.
2. **Timeliness** - Communicate updates early to prevent last-minute stress.
3. **Respect** - Listen as actively as you speak; value every contribution.
4. **Unity** - Use words that build up, not divide; rehearsals are ministry, not management.
5. **Documentation** - When decisions are made, write them down and share them.

## Best Practices

- Always begin major communications (emails, group chats, announcements) with prayerful intent — seek to inform, not impress.
- Directors and producers should send **weekly summaries**: schedules, focus points, and any changes.
- Use **one primary channel** (e.g., email, app, or printed sheet) to prevent message loss.
- Keep feedback moments structured — praise publicly, correct privately.
- Allow time for **questions and confirmations** at the end of each rehearsal.
- Encourage a culture of gratitude — thank those who serve faithfully behind the scenes.

## Ministry Focus

Words shape the spirit of the team.
Every message, instruction, or encouragement should mirror the grace and truth of Christ, building trust and unity in service.
