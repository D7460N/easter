# Rehearsal Devotionals

## Purpose

Devotionals anchor rehearsals in worship and remind every volunteer that our preparation is ministry, not performance.
A few minutes in Scripture and prayer refocus the heart, renews unity, and keeps God at the center of the work.

## Core Principles

1. **Keep it Simple** - Five to ten minutes is enough to center the team spiritually.
2. **Be Consistent** - Open or close every rehearsal with prayer and reflection.
3. **Be Relevant** - Choose verses that connect to the production's theme, message, or scene.
4. **Be Inclusive** - Encourage different volunteers to share occasionally.
5. **Be Worshipful** - End with gratitude and a prayer of dedication.

## Suggested Format

| Step                     | Focus                                              | Example                                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Welcome & Quiet**   | Invite stillness; remove distractions.             | “Let's take a moment to quiet our hearts.”                        |
| **2. Scripture Reading** | Select 1-3 verses related to the theme or service. | _Colossians 3:23_, _Psalm 96:1-2_                                 |
| **3. Reflection**        | Share a short insight or encouragement.            | “We serve through creativity — not for applause, but as worship.” |
| **4. Prayer**            | Dedicate rehearsal time to the Lord.               | Ask for focus, humility, and unity.                               |
| **5. Encouragement**     | End on a positive note.                            | “Let's give our best to God — together.”                          |
