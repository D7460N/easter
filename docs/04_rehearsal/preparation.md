# Rehearsal Preparation

## Purpose

Preparation honors God, respects others' time, and ensures that every rehearsal begins with focus and peace.
It's not just about learning lines or songs — it's about bringing a ready heart, clear mind, and servant attitude to the work of ministry.

## Core Principles

1. **Spiritual Readiness** - Pray before arriving; remember who and why you serve.
2. **Mental Focus** - Review material beforehand so rehearsal can be about refinement, not discovery.
3. **Physical Discipline** - Rest well, hydrate, and arrive early to set up and settle in.
4. **Team Respect** - Being prepared helps the entire team rehearse efficiently.
5. **Consistency** - Preparation builds trust; unpreparedness erodes it.

## Best Practices

- **Arrive Early** - Aim to be ready 10-15 minutes before start time.
- **Review Material** - Know your lines, cues, lyrics, or tech notes.
- **Check Equipment** - Ensure microphones, scripts, and props are in place.
- **Pray and Focus** - Quietly center yourself before rehearsal begins.
- **Bring Supplies** - Notebook, water, pencil, and personal Bible or script copy.
- **Stay Flexible** - Be ready for adjustments, rewrites, or new direction.
