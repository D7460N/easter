# Rehearsal Etiquette

## Core Principles

Rehearsal is sacred preparation.
How we conduct ourselves off stage is as important as what we present on it.

## Expectations

- Arrive early, prepared, and prayed up.
- Refrain from side conversations during notes or blocking.
- Respect leadership decisions even when changes occur.
- Silence phones and avoid distractions.
- Support others with encouragement, not critique.

## Spiritual Mindset

Rehearsal is where humility, unity, and patience are tested and refined.
